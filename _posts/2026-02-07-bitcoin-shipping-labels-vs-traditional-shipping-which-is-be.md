## Bitcoin Shipping Labels vs. Traditional Shipping: Which is Better?

If you're still using your local shipping store or a traditional online postage vendor, you're likely dealing with high fees, invasive tracking, and slow interfaces. Let's look at the numbers.

**Traditional Shipping:**
*   **Pricing:** Retail rates (Expensive).
*   **Requirements:** Full name, address, credit card, and account registration.
*   **Payment:** Credit card/Bank only (Tracking your spending).

**Bitcoin Shipping Labels:**
*   **Pricing:** Commercial rates (**4x cheaper than retail**).
*   **Requirements:** None. No account needed. Total privacy.
*   **Payment:** 100+ Cryptocurrencies. Fast and borderless.
