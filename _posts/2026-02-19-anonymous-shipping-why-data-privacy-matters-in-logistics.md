## Anonymous Shipping: Why Data Privacy Matters in Logistics

Every time you sign up for a traditional shipping account, you leave a digital footprint. From your phone number and home address to your credit card details, your "private" shipment is tracked by a dozen different data brokers before the package even leaves your porch.

**Bitcoin Shipping Labels** was built on the core cypherpunk tenet: Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world. 

### No Accounts. No Tracking. No KYC.
We believe you shouldn't have to create a permanent profile just to send a one-off gift or business package. At [https://www.bitcoinshippinglabels.com](https://www.bitcoinshippinglabels.com), we have completely eliminated the "Create Account" button. 

*   **No Personal Data Harvested:** We don't need your life story, just the shipping address.

*   **Minimal Footprint:** Once your label is generated, we don't spam your inbox or sell your data to advertisers.
