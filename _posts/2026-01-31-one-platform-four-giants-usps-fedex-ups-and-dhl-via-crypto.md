## One Platform, Four Giants: USPS, FedEx, UPS, and DHL via Crypto

Variety is the spice of logistics. Different packages require different carriers. You wouldn't send a heavy international crate via the same service you’d use for a local envelope. 

[Bitcoin Shipping Labels](https://www.bitcoinshippinglabels.com) brings the 'Big Four' together in one place, allowing you to pay for all of them using 100+ cryptocurrencies.

### Choose the Right Tool for the Job
*   **USPS:** The best choice for lightweight items and domestic residential delivery.
*   **UPS:** Reliable for heavy ground shipments and commercial addresses.
*   **FedEx:** The gold standard for time-sensitive, express deliveries.
*   **DHL:** The undisputed king of international logistics.

### Why Aggregate?
Instead of maintaining accounts with four different companies, you can compare rates across all of them at [https://www.bitcoinshippinglabels.com](https://www.bitcoinshippinglabels.com). You get the same professional service, the same tracking numbers, and the same reliable delivery—just at a lower price and with the privacy of crypto payments.
