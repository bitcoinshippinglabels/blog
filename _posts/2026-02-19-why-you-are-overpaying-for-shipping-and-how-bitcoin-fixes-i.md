## Why You Are Overpaying for Shipping (and How Bitcoin Fixes It)

Have you ever walked into a retail shipping center, handed over a small package, and felt your jaw drop at the total on the credit card machine? You aren’t alone. Retail shipping prices are intentionally inflated, often including massive markups to cover storefront overhead.

At **Bitcoin Shipping Labels**, we believe that sending a package shouldn't cost as much as the item inside. By leveraging commercial shipping rates, we provide users with labels that are up to **4x cheaper than retail shipping prices**. 

### The Mathematical Advantage of Commercial Rates
