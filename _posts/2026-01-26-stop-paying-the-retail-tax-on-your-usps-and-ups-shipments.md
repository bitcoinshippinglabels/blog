## Stop Paying the 'Retail Tax' on Your USPS and UPS Shipments

Did you know that walking into a store and paying for a label at the counter is the most expensive way to ship? Most people don't realize that 'Retail Rates' and 'Commercial Rates' can differ by 40% or more. At **Bitcoin Shipping Labels**, we bridge that gap.
