## Bitcoin Shipping Labels vs. Traditional Platforms: Which is Better?

When you need to send a package, you have choices. You could use a traditional online postage site, go to the retail counter, or use a crypto-native platform like [Bitcoin Shipping Labels](https://www.bitcoinshippinglabels.com). Let’s look at how they stack up.

### 1. Pricing
*   **Retail/Traditional:** High markups, often 40-60% above commercial rates.
*   **Bitcoin Shipping Labels:** Commercial pricing heritage. Save up to 75% off retail.

### 2. Privacy
*   **Traditional:** Requires Name, Phone, Email, Credit Card, and Address. Data is often shared with marketing partners.
*   **Bitcoin Shipping Labels:** No account required. Total privacy for the sender.

### 3. Payment Flexibility
*   **Traditional:** Credit card or PayPal only. Subject to bank freezes and international fees.
*   **Bitcoin Shipping Labels:** 100+ Cryptocurrencies accepted. Permissionless and global.

### The Verdict
For users who value their wallet's balance and their personal data's safety, the choice is clear. Traditional platforms are dinosaur relics of the pre-blockchain era.
